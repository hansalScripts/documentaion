## How it works?
As with any other offerwall platform, this system can be used either to monetize and website or to promote it. As a publisher, the user has to register his website into the system and integrate the offerwall into his website. Every time when his users will complete offers to receive rewards, publishers earn revenue.

### In details:
Offerwall is a way for your users to earn virtual currency (credits/points). Users can earn credits by completing different tasks. When the user successfully completes each task, he/she will receive a variable amount of the virtual currency and, at the same moment, you will receive your payout just as if the user had purchased credits with real money. Instead of paying, the user completes advertising campaigns and thus you get your money. The offerwall can be adapted to your computer or mobile phone.
