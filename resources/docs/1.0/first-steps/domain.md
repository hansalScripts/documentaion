# Get Domain
Getting a Domain is as simple as eating a piece of chocolate cake. you need to go to any Domain registrar company like Godaddy, Hostinger, Freenom, Namecheapâ€¦. and Buy a Domain Name, you can even get one for 1$ per year.
I do recommend getting a domain name that reflects your business. and if you already have one, as I think so, you can just skip this.
